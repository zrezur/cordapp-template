/**
 * This is the "Hello World" of flows!
 *
 * It is a generic flow which facilitates the workflow required for two parties; an [Initiator] and an [Acceptor],
 * to come to an agreement about some arbitrary data (in this case, a [PurchaseOrder]) encapsulated within a [DealState].
 *
 * As this is just an example there's no way to handle any counter-proposals. The [Acceptor] always accepts the
 * proposed state assuming it satisfies the referenced [Contract]'s issuance constraints.
 *
 * These flows have deliberately been implemented by using only the call() method for ease of understanding. In
 * practice we would recommend splitting up the various stages of the flow into sub-routines.
 *
 * NB. All methods called within the [FlowLogic] sub-class need to be annotated with the @Suspendable annotation.
 *
 * The flows below have been heavily commented to aid your understanding. It may also be worth reading the CorDapp
 * tutorial documentation on the Corda docsite (https://docs.corda.net) which includes a sequence diagram which clearly
 * explains each stage of the flow.
