/**
 * A implementation of a basic smart contract in Corda.
 *
 * This contract facilitates the business logic required for two parties to come to an agreement over a newly issued
 * [PurchaseOrderState], which in turn, encapsulates a [PurchaseOrder].
 *
 * For a new [PurchaseOrderState] to be issued onto the ledger a transaction is required which takes:
 * - Zero input states.
 * - One output state: the new [PurchaseOrderState].
 * - An Place() command with the public keys of the buyer and seller parties.
 * - A timestamp.
 *
 * The contract code (implemented within the [Timestamped] and [Issue] clauses) is run when the transaction is
 * verified via the verify() function.
 * - [Timestamped] checks for the existence of a timestamp
 * - [Place] runs a series of constraints, see more below
 *
 * All contracts must sub-class the [Contract] interface.
